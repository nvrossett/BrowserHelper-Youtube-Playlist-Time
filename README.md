### Youtube Playlist Time

<!-- [Para ler em portuguÃªs - clique aqui](https://github.com/nvrossett/BrowserHelper-Youtube-Playlist-Time/blob/master/LEIAME.md)

I've developed this code to help you calculate the estimated time for a playlist on youtube so you can plan your studies.
Adding also the option to estimate the time of videos with slow or fast speed.

For you who speak a language natively and want to consume a playlist with agility, or for you who are studying a new language and need the video at slow speed to understand the pronunciation of each word.

You have the estimated time of each video considering also this speed adjustment.
